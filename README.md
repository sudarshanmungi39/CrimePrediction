# CrimePrediction

CrimePrediction is a machine learning-based project aimed at analyzing historical crime data and building models to predict and understand crime patterns.
The goal is to assist authorities in making data-driven decisions to improve public safety.

## Project Description

This project analyzes crime data to predict future crime occurrences based on past patterns. It involves:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering (Temporal, Spatial, and Demographic Features)
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Visualization of Crime Patterns and Model Insights

## Project Structure

| Section | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Data Loading and Cleaning** | Load datasets, handle missing values, transform features |
| **Exploratory Data Analysis** | Visualize crime patterns, correlations, distributions |
| **Feature Engineering** | Create new features (date/time, location encoding, etc.) |
| **Data Balancing** | Handle class imbalance using SMOTE or similar |
| **Model Building** | Train ML models to classify crime types |
| **Model Evaluation** | Evaluate using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score |
| **Visualization and Insights** | Plot feature importance, confusion matrices, prediction results |
